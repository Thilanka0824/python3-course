# Python 3.x, the heart of data-science by VetsinTech: Coursework Repository

Hello there! Welcome to my coursework repository for the Python 3.x, the heart of data-science course offered by VetsinTech. This course provided an intensive introduction to Python 3.x, underlining its utility in data science applications. This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of the knowledge and skills I acquired throughout this course.

## Course Overview

Throughout this course, I gained an in-depth understanding of Python objects, dictionaries, lists (arrays), loops, conditionals, and foundational Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The learning curve spanned from Python basics to its applications in complex tasks like manipulating various data formats, web scraping, and interacting with live APIs.

### Topics Covered

- Introduction to Python & Python libraries
- Working with data types in Python
- Writing simple functions to manipulate input values
- Introduction to Functional Programming
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- Processing data from Excel, PDF, CSV, JSON, and more
- Basic web scraping
- Live API interaction

## Final Project

The course culminated with a capstone project that allowed me to put the acquired Python knowledge to practical use. This project showcases my capabilities in handling different data formats, performing web scraping, and interacting with APIs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized following the course curriculum. Each directory corresponds to a week of coursework, labeled by the week number and the topics covered.

Inside the directories, you will find:

- Detailed lecture notes
- Python code files demonstrating my understanding of concepts
- Completed assignments, showcasing problem-solving skills
- Relevant reading materials and references used

I invite you to browse through the repository to get a feel for my learning progression and the Python-based data-science skills I acquired throughout this course.

## Technologies Used

Throughout this course, I extensively used Python 3.x and several Python libraries. These libraries were utilized as needed for various tasks such as data manipulation, web scraping, and API interaction.
